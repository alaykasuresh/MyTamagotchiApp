RESEARCH REPORT:
Welcome to the world of virtual pets! In this report I will discuss the steps and reasonings on how I developed the Tamagotchi inspired app for a native Android user. The objective? To create an engaging experience where users can nurture and care for their virtual companions right from their smartphones. My task is to craft a seamless Tamagotchi app complete with a captivating welcome page that attracts users into the immersive world of pet care. Once inside, users will engage with their virtual pets, tending to their needs such as feeding, cleaning and playing, all while monitoring their pet’s health, hunger and cleanliness status closely. Just like our previous assignment, I will make use of GitHub and GitHub actions to streamline my development process ensuring efficiency and collaboration among team members. Through these tools, my aim is to deliver an exciting experience through my Tamagotchi app that will delight users of all ages.
The welcome page of my Tamagotchi app serves as the gateway to a delightful journey of virtual pet ownership. It's the first impression users will have of my app, so it needs to be inviting and captivating. my welcome page features vibrant visuals and playful animations to immediately grab users' attention and set the tone for the experience ahead. A cheerful greeting message accompanied by friendly pet characters helps users feel welcomed and excited to start caring for their virtual companions. In terms of functionality, the welcome page will provide clear calls-to-action to guide users seamlessly into the game. it's a prominent buttons, ensuring that users know exactly how to begin their adventure with their new virtual pet. Furthermore, the welcome page will offer brief but informative instructions on how to navigate the app and care for their pet. This will help users feel confident and empowered from the moment they start interacting with the app.

As you can see I've created multiple tabs for both the dog and cat on the welcome page. To grab the users attention as well as to make it unique to the app I decided to use meow! and woof! to indicate the different virtual pet options. I added a button for a cat called meow which will take you to a tab to show you where your virtual cat will be.

This is the design I decided to use for cat virtual pet, in the middle of the page is where the cat images will be generated, with ongoing research I developed a code with the image of the cat will change upon feeding, cleaning or playing with said virtual cat. With the use of buttons and progress bars, sure the user will be able to see the status levels of their virtual pet. As the user feeds, cleans ohh plays with their virtual pet, the status levels of the virtual pet will fluctuate. In addition to that, I also added a back button on the top right corner, that redirects the user back to the welcome page to allow them to switch to a different virtual pet.

With regards to the dog virtual pet, I added the exact same features with a different background to create a more unique experience.

When contemplating the user interface (UI) for my Tamagotchi app, several considerations come into play to ensure an intuitive and engaging experience for my users. First and foremost, simplicity is key. i wanted the UI to be easy to navigate, especially for users of varying ages and technological backgrounds. Clear and concise menu structures, prominent buttons for essential actions like feeding or cleaning, and intuitive gestures for interactions will be paramount. Additionally, considered the visual appeal of the UI. The design should be vibrant and eye-catching, with cheerful colours and playful pictures to enhance the experience and appeal to users' emotional connection with their virtual pets. In order to get the pictures I desired, I used the help of artificial intelligence to generate images of the animals where they are happy, sad, hungry and dirty to depict all the different emotions experienced by the virtual pet. However, it's crucial to strike a balance to avoid overwhelming the user with excessive visual elements. Accessibility is another crucial factor. my UI is inclusive, catering to users with different abilities and preferences. This means considering factors such as font size, colour contrast, and support for accessibility features built into the Android platform to ensure that all users can comfortably interact with the app. Furthermore, consistency across the UI is essential for a cohesive user experience. This includes consistent design patterns, terminology, and layout throughout the app, allowing users to easily predict how to navigate and interact with different screens and features. By carefully considering these factors and prioritizing user-centric design principles, I created a user interface for my Tamagotchi app that is both delightful to interact with and easy to understand, fostering a strong connection between users and their virtual pets.

I used the help of the AI magic media from the application called Canva to generate the images of my animals here's an example depicting what I did.

In designing my app, I wanted to make it accessible for people to move forward and back from the menu screen and the actual application. Therefore, from the knowledge I have gained from the module manual, I was able to create a back button on the actual game to go back to the welcome menu so that users would be able to change from a dog and a cat. I specifically chose these animals as these domesticated animals are widely loved globally and people may have their different preferences.

Down below I will add examples of game play for both the dog and the cat Tamagotchi virtual pet.

During the development of my Tamagotchi app, I encountered several challenges that tested my problem-solving skills and pushed me to explore creative solutions. One significant hurdle was figuring out how to dynamically change the images for feeding, cleaning, and playing actions. This involved understanding how to programmatically swap images based on user interactions, which required careful consideration of image resources and their corresponding actions. Additionally, implementing fluctuating progress bars to reflect the virtual pet's needs posed another challenge, as I needed to devise a mechanism to adjust the bars in real-time based on various factors such as time and user interactions. Moreover, sourcing suitable images for the app's visual elements proved to be a time-consuming task, requiring thorough research and consideration of copyright issues. Despite these challenges, I persisted in developing working code by experimenting with different approaches and seeking guidance from online resources and communities. Finally, ensuring the app was suitable and runnable involved rigorous testing across different devices and screen sizes to guarantee a seamless user experience. Through perseverance and determination, I successfully overcame these challenges, ultimately delivering a functional and enjoyable Tamagotchi app.
In conclusion, developing this Tamagotchi app using Kotlin has been a gratifying journey filled with learning experiences. Leveraging Kotlin's concise syntax and robust features, I've successfully crafted a user-friendly app that simulates the beloved Tamagotchi experience. From implementing feeding and playing interactions to monitoring the virtual pet's health, I aimed to recreate the nostalgic charm of the original Tamagotchi while infusing it with modern design principles and seamless user interactions. Throughout the development process, I encountered and overcame various challenges, refining my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of Kotlin's capabilities. Designing intuitive user interfaces and optimizing code for performance were just some of the hurdles I tackled with creativity and perseverance. As I look back on this project, I'm proud of the final result—a delightful Tamagotchi app that evokes joy and nostalgia in users of all ages Ultimately, this Tamagotchi app not only showcases the power of Kotlin but also serves as a testament to the enduring allure of virtual pet simulations, fostering a sense of responsibility and companionship that transcends generations.
